# fm
A TUI file manager written in rust

> Warning! This is a work in progress, use at your own risk

fm is a TUI file manager that I decided to write and see how far I could get. It's heavily inspried by [lf](https://github.com/gokcehan/lf) so it should feel pretty familiar if you've used it before.

# Features
- Colors? (Who doesn't like colors)
- Moving around the filesystem

As you can see it's not very feature rich yet but there are plenty of features being planned.

# Near Future
- Basic deleting, moving, copying, pasting 
- Preview contents of a directory or file
- Open a file in preferred text editor
- Config file for specific actions for specific files
- More keybinds for navigation
- And probably some other stuff (Custom Colors?)

# Installing
Clone the repository, open the file, and run

`$ cargo build --release`

Then navigate to 

`$ fm/target/release/`

There should be an executable there that you can move to your path

Enjoy!
